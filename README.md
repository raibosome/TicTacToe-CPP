# Tic Tac Toe

Hi this is a 2-player Tic Tac Toe game written in C++ just to get me started in this programming language.

This is how it looks like during the gameplay:

```txt
[*] - ali
[x] - baba

-------
|*|2|*|
|4|x|6|
|7|x|9|
-------

ali's turn. Select cell: 9
```

Compile with

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 tictactoe.cpp main.cpp -o tictactoe
```

and run 

```bash
./tictactoe
```
